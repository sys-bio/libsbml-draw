Summary of libsbml_draw 
--------------------------------
The SBML layout and render extensions enable SBML models to encode 
information about the graphical depiction of model elements.  
Layout provides information about the positions of model elements 
and render describes the styles of elements, for example, shapes, 
colors, line widths, and font details.  

libsbml_draw supports the SBML layout and render extensions and can 
automatically generate a layout for SBML models by making use of SBNW, 
a C/C++ library.
